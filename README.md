When contributing to the project please make your own branch and then issue a pull request for it to be added to the master branch. Please `git rebase -i` your commits into a single (or multiple if the revision is major) commit so it can easily be readable. All branches should be named in the following convention:
* All branch names should be in in lower case 
* Any spaces in branch names should be replaced with underscores
* Please use `feature/your_branch_name` for any general code improvements

These guidelines are in place due to the website's code being sourced from the master branch
